<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The web app uses a relational database to allow users to collaboratively build a compendium of all the people, places, and things that animate a role-playing campaign setting.</p>
<p>Players and Game Masters can join their own shared campaign in which everyone views the index of notable entries as their home page, and anyone can add new information.</p>
<p>Originally, this app was a project submission to CS50x, but through continued development it has been released as a standalone web app.</p>
